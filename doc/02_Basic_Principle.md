# Basic Principle

Pimcore Datahub allows defining multiple endpoints that allow data delivery and consumption. These 
endpoints are configured via so called configurations that can be added in Pimcore admin user interface: 

## Adding a new configuration

Open Datahub configuration panel

![Configuration Overview](./img/graphql/configuration3.png)


Choose endpoint technology 

![Add Configuration](./img/add_config.png)

And get the configuration done by defining 
- general settings
- schema configuration
- security definitions
- and additional settings

Example for [GraphQL](./10_GraphQL/README.md)
