# Basic Principle

Pimcore data-hub allows to define multiple endpoints that allow data delivery and consumption. These 
endpoints are configured via so called configurations that can be added in Pimcore admin user interface: 

## Adding a new configuration

Open data-hub configuration panel

![Configuration Overview](./img/graphql/configuration3.png)


Choose endpoint technology 

![Add Configuration](./img/add_config.png)

And get the configuration done by defining 
- general settings
- schema configuration
- security definitions
- and additional settings

Example for [GraphQL](./10_GraphQL/README.md)
