# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think that you have found a security issue, 
don’t use the bug tracker and don’t publish it publicly. 
Instead, all security issues must be reported via a private vulnerability report.

Please follow the [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) to submit a private report.


## Resolving Process
Every submitted security issue is handled with top priority by following these steps: 

1. Confirm the vulnerability
2. Determine the severity
3. Contact reporter
4. Work on a patch
5. Get a CVE identification number (may be done by the reporter or a security service provider)
6. Patch reviewing 
7. Tagging a new release for supported versions
8. Publish security announcement
